          <li>Every person will receive a playing card when they get their first drink.</li>
          <li>You should not get more than one.</li>
          <li>On each card will be either a question or a task (<i>cough truth or dare cough</i>).</li>
          <li>When you meet someone (new or old), you can ask them to answer or do what is written on your card. They should do the same to you.</li>
          <li>Failure to do so results in a penalty <a href="drinks.html">shot</a>.</li>
          <li>Upon completion, exchange playing cards.</li>
          <li><i>Tom do we win anything?</i> Yes, friendship</li>
          <br />
          <li>Every half hour, Tom will draw a card. Everyone who has that suit or rank drinks with Tom. If he draws a Joker, everyone drinks</li>
